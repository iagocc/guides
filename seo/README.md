## Detailed instructions

### Have you installed Google Analytics & Google Webmasters?

You can’t get any better advice than from the search engines themselves; Google
Webmasters scans your site for errors and reports any problems which might
affect your search engine friendliness.   Google Analytics will report on SEO
efforts are paying off, both work in tandem and I would consider both essential
to any website, especially if your site has no analytics at all.

### Have you checked for any messages from Google Webmasters?

Always make sure you check for messages from Google and take action as soon as
you can.  Google Webmasters reports on any errors search engine robots find when
browsing your website, such as HTML improvements, pages Google can’t access etc.

### Check for broken links

Clean up any problem or dead links on your site in one fell swoop with Screaming
Fog (It’s free)

### Is your site mobile friendly?

Responsive design is a necessity since the advent of Google’s mobile ranking
update.  Check how your site appears on multiple screen sizes and that it
matches Google’s criteria for mobile design.

### Check your page load speed

Page load speed is a growing factor for search engines, leading to countless
frustrations from consumers (especially mobile users), speed can also have a big
impact of your bottom line..

How fast your web pages load and what might be slowing them down can be easily
checked using free tools like PageSpeedInsights – The tool also gives a lot of
advice to improve your load time too.

### Check for duplicate content

Use Google Webmaster Tools to check that your site doesn’t have any duplicate
content that may be affecting your site being indexed.  It’s also good practice
to chuck any articles or bulk content into a plagiarism checker.

### Check for thin pages

Do all of your web pages have a reasonable amount of text? Ideally at least 100
words of content.  Over the past few years Google has been culling millions of
websites with “thin pages”.

### Is your content localized?

By no means essential but if you want to rank well on a local town, city or
neighborhood level you should spread local keywords & locally relevant content
throughout your website.

### Are your page titles & descriptions written correctly?

Make sure you have written a keyword focused page title & description to be
shown in the search pages.

Keep your titles under 55 characters (Google won’t show the rest)
Keep your descriptions under 155 characters
Have you used any header (H1, H2, H3 etc..) tags?

Always include one H1 tag with your focus keyword, subsequent header tags should
lead down the page in order: 2, 3, 4 etc.. – How to use heading tags

### Do your web pages have focus keywords & synonyms?

High ranking pages are usually written around a very specific topic and the
content is geared towards one or more surrounding keywords. – Find trending
keywords in your niche

### Do you have descriptive URLs?

Do your page links describe themselves and include your focus keyword?

Above anything always avoid non-descriptive URL’s such as
www.example.com/17141.html

### Have you submitted an XML sitemap to Google/Bing?

XML sitemaps help search engines to crawl and indefx your website more quickly,
you can create a sitemap using XML Sitemaps Generator, think about how often
your pages will be updated and how often search engines should re-visit.

Submit your sitemap to Google
Submit your sitemap to Bing
Have you created a robots.txt?

The robots.txt document is used to control what areas of your website search
engines should crawl/index.  Generate a robots.txt with SEO Book.

### Have you created alt-tags for your images?

Search engines don’t understand images all that well, so we use alt tags to
describe what the image is about.  Image alt tags can help to direct traffic
from Google Image Searches and increase the relevancy of your pages. – What is
an Image Alt Tag?

### Is your website easy to follow?

You might have great content but don’t neglect a good user experience.  Can
people easily get around your website?  Earn some extra brownie points with the
search engines by giving a good UX.

### Does your website have a secure HTTPS URL (SSL Certificate)?

Google reported last year that they will now reward websites that encrypt
shoppers information through secure HTTPS URLs. – SSL Certificates from Global
Sign

### Are there a variety of links pointing to your website?

Links that point to your website are one of the most important methods for
determining popularity.  What search engines really want to see is a variety of
links from different types of websites:

Social media, Trusted blogs, niche news websites, old & new websites,
Directories etc..

### Have you checked your competitors’ backlinks?

It is always good practice to see where your competitors are getting their
backlinks, especially if they have a proven track record in the search results.
You may find some new opportunities yourself or learn more about the specific
key terms they are targeting.  – Ahrefs Backlink Checker

### Have you claimed all relevant social profiles?

I would recommend that you are active on at least one or two of the big social
networks but at the very least you should claim your brand name & link your page
to your website for any future use.

Check for availability with NameChk

### Does your website make social sharing easy?

Social media shares & comments all contribute towards your search ranking and
are now an expectation of what search engines would call a “Good online brand”.
Ensure that social share buttons are prominent across your website.

Have you submitted your website to Yelp, Urban Spoon, Trip Advisor etc..?

http://www.urbanspoon.com (Restaurants)

In addition to explicit links that point to your website search engines now pay
particular attention to positive online reviews (especially for local business).

### Have you submitted/checked your Google My Business listing?

Make sure that your business & website can be found across all of Google’s
services, including search, maps/places, Google+ and that contact information,
opening hours etc.. are all correct.
