# UX-Design


## What is user experience design?

User experience design (abbreviation UX, UXD) – A discipline focused on
designing the end-to-end experience of a certain product. To design an
experience means to plan and act upon a certain set of actions, which should
result in a planned change in the behaviour of a target group (when interacting
with a product).

A UX designer’s work should always be derived from people’s problems and aim at
finding a pleasurable, seductive, inspiring solution. The results of that work
should always be measurable through metrics describing user behaviour. UX
designers use knowledge and methods that originate from psychology,
anthropology, sociology, computer science, graphic design, industrial design and
cognitive science.

## The heart of UX-design

Is constant iterative optimisation. The problem of future users. We need to spot
it, define it, feel the pain and eliminate it.

To stay on the right track we need  a lot of empathy and analytical skills,
because the tricky thing with problems is that we are having a hard time 
defining them. Even if they trouble us.

The key to success is to actually get to know your clients. Arm yourself with
empathy and talk to them.

## C-P-S hypothesis

If you've reached the target group and interviewed its members for a serious
problem, it's about time to define the basis of your product in a triangle.

Before the launch of a product everything is a hypothesis.

The C-P-S hypothesis is a basic description of any product. It reaches the core
of any succesful endeavour in a neat, minimalistic way.

My product is specified. The C-P-S hypothesis forms the backbone of the whole
product.
Each part of C-P-S is questionable on its own. I might wrongly describe the
target group. I could misunderstand a problem my target group is having. Or we
could create a product that doesn't address the problem users are facing.
